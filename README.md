day 1 - i learned how to put together my github account. i also downloaded jupyter notebook, the lab, python and experimented with different libraries. i really enjoyed the introduction session that occured at the beginning of the day. 


day 2 - i learned how to put together an interesting story and capture attention of my listeners. i later watched another video that showed similar techniques and backed up the information i learned the day. 


day 3 - i learned the different structure of AI and all the subsections.
i.  what is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
- supervised learning uses labeled data to train algorithims into classifying data and predict outcomes. under supervised learning there is classication(algorithim to accurately assgin test data into specific categories; decision trees and linear classifiers) and regression(uses an algorithim to unferstand the relationship between dependent and independent variables; predict numerical values (linear regression, logistic regression) 
- unsupervised learning uses machine learning algorithims to analyze and cluster unlabeled data sets. they discover hidden patterns in data without the need for human intervention. under unsupervised learning there is clustering(data mining technique that groups based on their similarities or differences) association(uses different rules to find relationships between variables in given dataset) dimensionality reduction (number of features in a given dataset is too high)
- in supervised learning the algorithim learns from the training dataset while unsupervised learns from random collected data
ii. describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries
- scikit learn is a library of algorithims, it is built based of a few math python libraries which allows it to have so many abilities. without mini data anlysis libraries it is unable to perform those actions

day 4 - today we learned about different datasets that are available for solving differing issues. 
- the dataset that i found was a collection of data from the national hurricane center and central pacific hurricane center. i collected this data so that i could solve the issue of predicting tropical storms and hurricanes. by training systems to recognize patterns prior to the occurence of a storm https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/
- the algorithim for predicting these patterns should not be overly complex because the resulting hurricane always remains the same. what should be changing are the factors that go into their creation, wind, humidity, and other weather factors. 
- an additonal algorithim can be developed into predicting how intense the hurricane will be. 


day 7 - 
what are tensors and and what are they used for in machine learning? 
a tensor is a mathematical representation of a physical entity that may be characterized by magnitude and multiple directons. it is represented by a R number in a particular dimensional space. in a N dimensional space scalars will be  represented with 1 number, vectors need N numbers and tensors need N^R. a vector is a one-dimensional or first order tensor and a matrix is a two-dimensional or second order tensor. in the machine learning world tensors allow the design of 3 dimensional shapes
what did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?
when i ran the first set of code the values did not actually get multiplied out because the tensorflow was lazy in the not interactive environment. i also ran this code through an editor (atom) and then opened it through my terminal, where the values were actually calculated. 

day 8 - today i learned about the structure of neural networks and how they are built. the session was long, but I learned more by rewatching the sessions. code in process


day 9 - in process

day 10 - 
How do you think Machine Learning or AI concepts were utilized in the design of this game?
In this game the creators utilized the skillsets that recruiters would need to look for when hiring employees. Using these skillsets the AI began to recognize the pattern of what was looked for when hiring workers. The orange workers were also the ones with the best assets. The best workers would go to the front of the line because AI learned thats where I would look first. 
Can you give a real-world example of a biased machine learning model, and share your ideas on how you make this model more fair, inclusive, and equitable? Please reflect on why you selected this specific biased model.
An example of a biased machine learning model could be one that predicts test scores from different places around NYC. Because of outside factors like family situation and poverty level students are capable of attending school at differnt amounts. Usually environments with lower class families require students to work more and study less often. However, just because a student is from a certain place does not mean they could easily be an outlier. The model would be predicting straight off the bat that those students would be doing worse
