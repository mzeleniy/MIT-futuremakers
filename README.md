day 1 - i learned how to put together my github account. i also downloaded jupyter notebook, the lab, python and experimented with different libraries. i really enjoyed the introduction session that occured at the beginning of the day. 


day 2 - i learned how to put together an interesting story and capture attention of my listeners. i later watched another video that showed similar techniques and backed up the information i learned the day. 


day 3 - i learned the different structure of AI and all the subsections.
i.  what is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
- supervised learning uses labeled data to train algorithims into classifying data and predict outcomes. under supervised learning there is classication(algorithim to accurately assgin test data into specific categories; decision trees and linear classifiers) and regression(uses an algorithim to unferstand the relationship between dependent and independent variables; predict numerical values (linear regression, logistic regression) 
- unsupervised learning uses machine learning algorithims to analyze and cluster unlabeled data sets. they discover hidden patterns in data without the need for human intervention. under unsupervised learning there is clustering(data mining technique that groups based on their similarities or differences) association(uses different rules to find relationships between variables in given dataset) dimensionality reduction (number of features in a given dataset is too high)
- in supervised learning the algorithim learns from the training dataset while unsupervised learns from random collected data
ii. describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries
- scikit learn is a library of algorithims, it is built based of a few math python libraries which allows it to have so many abilities. without mini data anlysis libraries it is unable to perform those actions
